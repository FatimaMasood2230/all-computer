<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>INCREASING POPULATION</u></a></center></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Increasing population is creating many issues but it also plays negative role in polluting the water. Increasing population leads to increase in solid waste generation . Solid and liquid waste is discharged in to rivers. Water is also contaminated by human excreta. In contaminated water, a large number of bacteria are also found which is harmful for human health. Government is incapable to supply essential needs to citizens because of increasing number of population. Sanitation facilities are more in urban areas than rural areas. Polythene bag and plastic waste is a major source of pollution. Waste is thrown away by putting it in to plastic bags. It is estimated that three core people of urban areas defecate in open. 77% people are using flush latrines and 8% are using pit latrines. Urbanization can cause many infectious diseases. Overcrowding, unhygienic conditions, unsafe drinking water are major health issues in urban areas. One quarter of urban population is susceptible to disease.
