<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES</u></a></center></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Under construction activities like mining, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, stations, roads, flyovers takes place in almost every part of the world.
These construction activities take place every day as we need more buildings, bridges to accommodate more people. 
However, while this does help us to some degree, in the long run, the noise from construction activities hinders the hearing abilities of individuals exposed to this sound.
A part of it includes construction workers who participate in these activities, while another part of it consists of people who encounter these noise either from their homes or while traveling.
