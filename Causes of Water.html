<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>DOMESTIC SEWAGE</u></a></center></h1>
 <p style="font-size:20">Large amount of domestic sewage is drained in to river and most of the sewage is untreated. Domestic sewage contains toxicants, solid waste, plastic litters and bacterial contaminants and these toxic materials causes water pollution. Different industrial effluent that is drained in to river without treatment is the major cause of water pollution. Hazardous material discharged from the industries is responsible for surface water and ground water contamination. Contaminant depends upon the nature of industries. Toxic metals enter in to water and reduced the quality of water. 25% pollution is caused by the industries and is more harmful.

<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>INCREASING POPULATION</u></a></center></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Increasing population is creating many issues but it also plays negative role in polluting the water. Increasing population leads to increase in solid waste generation . Solid and liquid waste is discharged in to rivers. Water is also contaminated by human excreta. In contaminated water, a large number of bacteria are also found which is harmful for human health. Government is incapable to supply essential needs to citizens because of increasing number of population. Sanitation facilities are more in urban areas than rural areas. Polythene bag and plastic waste is a major source of pollution. Waste is thrown away by putting it in to plastic bags. It is estimated that three core people of urban areas defecate in open. 77% people are using flush latrines and 8% are using pit latrines. Urbanization can cause many infectious diseases. Overcrowding, unhygienic conditions, unsafe drinking water are major health issues in urban areas. One quarter of urban population is susceptible to disease.

<h1 style="font-size:40"><u><center>PESTICIDES</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Pesticides are used to kill bacteria, pest and different germs. Chemical containing pesticides are directly polluting the water and affect the quality of water. If pesticides are excess in amount or poorly managed then it would be hazardous for agriculture ecosystem.Only 60% fertilizers are used in the soil other chemicals leached in to soils polluting the water, cyanobacteria are rich in polluted water and excess phosphate run off leads to eutrophication. Residues of chemicals mix with river water due to flooding, heavy rainfall, excess irrigation and enter in the food chain. These chemicals are lethal for living organisms and many vegetables and fruits are contaminated with these chemicals. Trace amounts of pharmaceutical in water also causes water pollution and it is dangerous to human health.
