<h1><u><center>PRODUCERS</h1></u></center>
<p style="font-size:20">Those organisms which produce food are called producers. Producers are the organisms which can prepare their own food from simple inorganic substances like carbon dioxide and water by using sunlight energy in the presence of chlorophyll.<br><br>
The Examples of producers are green plants and certain blue-green, algae. The green plants synthesize their food during photosynthesis by taking raw materials from the earth and energy from the sun maize (makkd) as food.

The green plants produce carbohydrates by photosynthesis and also synthesize proteins and fats. Thus, the green plants are called producers in the living world. Producers are the autotrophic organisms (self- feeder organisms) in the ecosystem upon which other organisms depend for food. Thus, producers (like green plants) are autotrophs.
