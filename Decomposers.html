<h1><u><center>DECOMPOSERS</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">A decomposer is an organism that decomposes, or breaks down, organic material such as the remains of dead organisms. Decomposers include bacteria and fungi. These organisms carry out the process of decomposition, which all living organisms undergo after death. Decomposition is an important process because it allows organic material to be recycled in an ecosystem. 
(both autotrophs and heterotrophs). 
<br>For Example: Bacteria,Fungi<br><br>
<p style="font-size:20">Following is the role of a decomposer in the ecosystem:
<ul type="disc">
<li>They act as a cleaning agent of the environment by decomposing the dead plants and animals.
<li>They help in recycling the nutrients.
<li>They provide space for new being in the biosphere by decomposing the dead.
<li>They help in putting back the various elements into water, soil and air for the reuse of producers like crop plants.
<br><br></li>
