<p style="font-size:18">Water pollution is one of the major environmental issues in India. But before getting into the specifics of the state of Ganga River and major water pollution in India, we should learn about what water pollution is. Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, seas, lakes, groundwater, etc. This pollution is caused by the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly into water bodies without any concern for its toxicity or its effect on the environment. The pollutants here can be a variety of things, the sewage from houses which mostly consists of organic wastes or the highly toxic chemicals released into the water by factories, etc.Although organic wastes from houses are a lot less harmful than the discharge from industries, the sheer amount of organic waste generated by the humans on the planet can still be detrimental to the health of the water body.</p>
