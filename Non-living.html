 <p style="font-size:20">Abiotic factors are all of the non-living things in an ecosystem.
 
 Both biotic and abiotic factors are related to each other in an ecosystem, and if one factor is changed or removed, it can affect the entire ecosystem. Abiotic factors are especially important because they directly affect how organisms survive.</p>
 
 <p style="font-size:20">Abiotic components includes:</p>
<ul style="font-size:18">
<li>Physical environment (like soil water and air)
<li>Inorganic substances or nutrients (such as carbon dioxide, oxygen nitrogen water and all the minerals)
<li>Climate factors such as temperature, light, humidity, wind and atmospheric pressure.
</ul>
