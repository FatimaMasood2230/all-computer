<h1><u><center>CONSUMERS</center></u></h1>
<p style="font-size:20">Those organisms which consume food (eat food) prepared by producers are called consumers. The consumers depend on producers for food, directly or indirectly. The consumers get their food by eating other organisms or their products. In most simple words, consumers are the organisms that eat other organisms.All the animals are consumers. Even the microscopic animal lives of the water called protozoa are consumer organisms.
The bio-mass of grass and plants supplies food and energy to these animals like cow and buffalo. It should be noted that the consumer organisms like animals cannot prepare food from simple inorganic substances through photosynthesis.
<br><br>
 For Example: All 
animals including humans. Though in a general sense, we prepare our own food by cooking the raw materials 
used are obtained from either plants or animals which again gain energy from plants only.
<p style="font-size:20">Consumers can be classified as:
<ul style="font-size:20">
<li>Herbivores (Primary consumers)</li>
<li>Carnivores (Secondary consumers)</li>
<li>Omnivores and parasite</li>
</ul>
